                <p class="w3-opacity"><strong>World Renowned Painter</strong></p>
                <p class="w3-justify">Georgia O’Keeffe was an American painter and one of the most significant artists
                    of the 20th century. She was born in 1887 on a Wisconsin farm as the second of seven children.
                    She was determined from a very young age to become an artist and studied multiple forms of painting
                    and drawing from watercolor to charcoal. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art
                    Students League in New York, where she learned the techniques of traditional painting, but her own style
                    continued to develop over the years as she studied, traveled, and was influenced by other artists.
                    O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including her famous close-ups of flowers, that many
                    found to be very sensuous in nature. She is also known for her marriage to art dealer and
                    photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who she lived with in New York. She was inspired by the Southwest
                    landscape and relocated to New Mexico permanently after Stieglitz's death, where she lived until she
                    died in 1986. Eleven years after her death, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum was established in New
                    Mexico. In 2014, one of her paintings sold for $44,405,000, which was said to have been more than three 
                    times the previous world auction record for any female artist at that time. </p>
