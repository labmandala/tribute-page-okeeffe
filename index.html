                <h2 class="w3-wide">ARTIST</h2>
                <p class="w3-opacity"><strong>World Renowned Painter</strong></p>
                <p class="w3-justify">Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe was an American painter and one of the most significant artists
                    of the 20th century. She was born in 1887 on a Wisconsin farm as the second of seven children.
                    She was determined from a very young age to become an artist and studied multiple forms of painting
                    and drawing from watercolor to charcoal. She graduated high school at Chatham Episcopal Institute
                    in Virginia and went on to study at several colleges and universities over the years, including 
                    The Art Institute of Chicago, University of Virginia, Teachers College at Columbia University, and 
                    The Art Students League in New York, before going on to teach at Columbia College in South Carolina.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-justify">Through her studies she learned the techniques of traditional painting, but her own style
                    continued to develop over the years as she studied, traveled, and was influenced by other artists.
                    She pursued her unique style, which caught the attention of gallery owners in New York.
                    O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including her famous close-ups of flowers, that many
                    found to be very sensuous in nature, but also painted landscapes and other natural imagery, and even 
                    city skylines during her time in New York. 
                </p>
                <p class="w3-justify">O'Keeffe is also known for her marriage to art dealer and
                    photographer Alfred Stieglitz, the first gallery owner to show her work, who she lived with  
                    in New York. She was inspired by the Southwest
                    landscape and relocated to New Mexico permanently after Stieglitz's death, where she lived until she
                    died in 1986, having made upwards of 2,000 paintings. Eleven years after her death, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum was established in New
                    Mexico. In 2014, one of her paintings sold for $44,405,000, which was said to have been more than
                    three times the previous world auction record for any female artist at that time.
